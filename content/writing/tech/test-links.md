This document is used to test the new markdown link styles.

### Inline Links

Here is an [inline link to Google](https://www.google.com) to see the underline color.

You can also have [internal links](/writing/px-vs-rem/) to other posts.

### Paragraph with multiple links

In a paragraph, we might have [multiple links](https://example.com) that appear [close to each other](https://example.org). This helps verify the `text-underline-offset` and the transition effect when hovering.

### List of links

- [Link One](https://example.com/1)
- [Link Two](https://example.com/2)
- [Link Three](https://example.com/3)

### Link in a blockquote

> This is a blockquote with a [link inside it](https://example.com).

### Link with formatting

- **[Bold Link](https://example.com)**
- *[Italic Link](https://example.com)*
- `[Code Link](https://example.com)` (Note: code blocks might have their own styles)
