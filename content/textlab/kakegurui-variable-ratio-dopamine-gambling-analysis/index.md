## Plot summary

The story of Kakegurui – Compulsive Gambler takes place at Hyakkaou Private Academy (私立百花王学園), one of Japan's most prestigious schools where, unlike normal schools, the hierarchy is determined by gambling. The main protagonist is Yumeko Jabami (蛇喰夢子), a transfer student whose beautiful, innocent facade hides a psychotic addiction to gambling and high-stakes situations. With a keen intellect able to pierce through the elaborate cheating methods used by the most powerful students to rig games in their favor, Yumeko threatens to destroy the twisted hierarchy of the school simply for the thrill of it.

## OST

There are 61 soundtracks for the 12 episodes of TV anime. The styles for the soundtracks are mainly jazz and electronic music.

**For jazz, it has these functions:**

- Creates not only a debauched atmosphere of the shedding of money and the indulgence in pleasures but also shows the conceit of characters. (賭ケグルイ、艶ヤカナ狂気、華ヒラク蛇、下卑タ笑ミ、变ヨウ) Display a silent, and nervous mood (兆シ)

**For electronic music, it has these functions:**

- Emphasize the overwhelming confidence in a character (昂ル)

**Others:**

- Specific for the game with Mitari Yikishima (生志摩 妄): A tune for a woman who fearlessly pursuing death like a cowboy in the West, for the Russian Roulette which determines life or death, for the silent faith among Yumeko and Ryota. (妄二欲ス、生キ死ニノ際)

**OP** (deal with the devil): Leaping tempo combines with 色気の声 expound why 肝心なの strong な mind, tally with the content of the TV anime.

**ED** (LAYon-theLINE): The chorus and the strings not only intertwine to form the triumphal song of the winner but also leave the opportunity for the next carnival.

## Frame

The overall quality of the frame is mediocre, especially for a MAPPA anime. Compares to the original manga, there is a significant reduction in aesthetic perception. 顔芸で強烈な impact is one of the highlights of this artwork.

# Yumeko's gambling notion

### Variable Ratio schedule

In order to discuss why Yumeko loves gambling in a psychotic way, we need to know what kind of reinforcement schedule gambling is.

A **schedule of reinforcement** determines which occurrences of a specific response result in the presentation of a **reinforcer**. (Wayne Weiten, *Psychology Themes and Variations*, 245) In a casino game, the reinforcer might include the behavior of others, the degree of the risk of the game, one's own principal, etc. These factors, or reinforcers, will influence the occurrences of the response: the pleasure gained from gambling.

Since gambling has its own unique characteristic: unpredictability, it is a kind of variable-ratio (VR) schedule. People involved in gambling do not know when they can win the gamble and get pleasure, thus:

> With a variable-ratio (VR) schedule, the reinforcer is given after a variable number of nonreinforced responses. The number of nonreinforced responses varies around a predetermined average. (Wayne Weiten, Psychology Themes and Variations, 246)
> 

> In comparison to fixed schedules, variable schedules tend to yield steadier responding and greater resistance to extinction. (Wayne Weiten, Psychology Themes and Variations, 246)

Simply put, due to the variable-ratio schedule, all gamblers will **continue** to gamble steadily after they have engaged in the activity of gambling and the gambling behavior will **not easily disappear**.

### Dopamine

In the schedule, dopamine plays a role as **positive reinforcement**, which serves as a reward and makes that behavior more likely to occur again in the future.

The uncertainty of gambling allows dopamine to possess these properties:

> According to this hypothesis proposed by Montague, Dayan, and Sejnowski, rewards that are expected do not produce a second phasic dopamine response in certain dopaminergic cells, but rewards that are unexpected, or greater than expected, produce a short-lasting increase in synaptic dopamine, whereas the omission of an expected reward actually causes dopamine release to drop below its background level (Schultz W, "Neuronal Reward and Decision Signals: From Theories to Data", 95 (3): 853–951. )
> 

Such a phenomenon explains why **Yumeko abhors any way of making the outcome of a gamble towards a definite answer**. In the duel with Mitari Yikishima (生志摩 妄), Yumeko senses that Mitari has no quest for gambling, but is purely bent on death. She expresses her utmost contempt for Mitari. In addition, Yumeko enjoys the process of gambling——either by pure luck or by her possibly higher cheating skill, either of which does not make the outcome certain. Her extreme risk-seeking may cause by some specific dopamine receptors or her age of adolescence. A study has shown that adolescents and young adults take more risks than any other age group (Joe Magliano, Why Are Teen Brains Designed for Risk-taking).

### Pain

When people encounter pain, **endorphins** will be released from a person's pituitary gland from the central nervous system and inhibit the transmission of pain signals. For Yumeko, the anxiety and pain she gets from gambling are short-lived, but the endorphins then work to keep her joy and passionate mood. Thus, she might have **high endorphin levels.**

## Conclusion

Yumeko Jabami may have a rare physique——having specific dopamine receptors and high levels of endorphins. In the pursuit of maximum joy, she even ignored all the risks. In combination with the system of gambling: variable ratio schedule, during each gambling session, Yumeko will experience the supreme pleasure of dopamine and endorphins being secreted in large quantities at the same time.
