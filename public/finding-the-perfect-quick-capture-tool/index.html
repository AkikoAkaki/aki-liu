<p>My obsession with &ldquo;recording tools&rdquo; has persisted for quite a long time. Because I frequently have text processing needs, I have been searching for the perfect portable, quick-capture tool.</p>
<h2 id="the-early-days-from-paper-to-e-ink">The Early Days: From Paper to E-Ink</h2>
<p>Early on, I was a loyal advocate of digital notes. Since junior high, I tried to abandon paper notebooks. The disadvantages of paper are obvious: the data is inflexible, cannot be exported, is hard to edit, and even simple typos or messy handwriting can clutter an entire page.</p>
<p>At that time, my only electronic device was a classic Kindle. It was eye-friendly, multi-functional, and compact. It could export reading notes directly into a spreadsheet, which was enough for me back then. However, as a recording tool, it had a fatal flaw: <strong>it lacked any optimization for editing</strong>. The E-ink refresh rate was low, requiring me to press every character &ldquo;slowly and firmly&rdquo; to type. Despite this, I specifically imported a custom e-book and did quite a bit of creative writing inside it using the annotation feature.</p>
<h2 id="the-exploration-phase-trial-error-and-trade-offs">The Exploration Phase: Trial, Error, and Trade-offs</h2>
<h3 id="simplenote-the-former-industry-standard">Simplenote: The Former Industry Standard</h3>

<p>After entering college, Simplenote became my daily driver. It was practically the benchmark for the software industry: minimalist, high performance, Markdown support, excellent compatibility, forever free, and exportable data. Even looking back now, it’s hard for me to find fault with it.</p>
<p>The main reason I eventually replaced it was simple: <strong>it doesn&rsquo;t support images.</strong>
However, I really admired its recycling bin mechanism—when notes are deleted, they aren&rsquo;t automatically emptied but are kept forever. This unintentionally acted as an &ldquo;automatic archive.&rdquo; Opening Simplenote occasionally during college and seeing texts I casually wrote in junior high often filled me with nostalgia.</p>
<h3 id="google-keep-the-concern-of-data-sovereignty">Google Keep: The Concern of Data Sovereignty</h3>
<figure><img src="/aki-liu/finding-the-perfect-quick-capture-tool/3.png">
</figure>

<p>I briefly tried Google Keep after discovering it was integrated into Gemini. I was intrigued by the concept of &ldquo;AI + Notes,&rdquo; so I thought about switching my quick capture tool to Google Keep.</p>
<p>Keep has the typical Google product style: Web-native and lightweight. Its card stream view is great for an overview, and it supports images and collaboration.</p>
<p>But its text formatting support is minimal (no Markdown), and it is unfriendly to long text. The core reason I abandoned it, however, was <strong>the inability to export data</strong>. As someone who values data control, I cannot tolerate the risk of my data instantly evaporating if my Google account were to be banned. Now, I only use it to record temporary information that I don&rsquo;t mind losing.</p>
<h3 id="upnote-almost-perfect">Upnote: Almost Perfect</h3>
<figure><img src="/aki-liu/finding-the-perfect-quick-capture-tool/2.png">
</figure>

<p>I turned to Upnote as a modern alternative to Simplenote that supports images. Upnote features a notebook system, workspaces, and real-time Markdown rendering.</p>
<p>Many people love its aesthetic, considering it clean, fast, and elegant. It does indeed perform well. But after using it for a while, I found it wasn&rsquo;t quite <strong>polished</strong> enough. The operation bar is too cluttered, and it feels strongly <strong>Rich-text oriented</strong> (you can&rsquo;t paste directly from Markdown source). The list layout on mobile wasn&rsquo;t compact enough for my liking.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the free version&rsquo;s limit of only 50 notes drove me away—paying for that feature set didn&rsquo;t feel worth it.</p>
<h3 id="notesnook-the-conflict-between-encryption-and-format">Notesnook: The Conflict Between Encryption and Format</h3>
<figure><img src="/aki-liu/finding-the-perfect-quick-capture-tool/4.png">
</figure>

<p>After leaving Upnote, a newer, minimalist, encrypted note-taking app called Notesnook caught my attention.</p>
<p>I thought this would be my next tool: concise, lightweight, modern, beautiful, open-source, private, and supporting images and publishing. I still think it’s a very good app, and I prefer it over Upnote.</p>
<p>However, I abandoned it before diving too deep. It has a fatal pain point: <strong>it is not Markdown native.</strong> Does it support Markdown shortcuts during editing? Yes, but the underlying format isn&rsquo;t Markdown. This means I cannot easily copy notes out as Markdown text.</p>
<h2 id="why-werent-the-mainstream-tools-suitable">Why Weren&rsquo;t the Mainstream Tools Suitable?</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Evernote:</strong> Used it very early on (elementary/middle school), but it quickly became unbearably bloated.</li>
<li><strong>Obsidian:</strong> I still use Obsidian, but I have refactored it into a deep-linked &ldquo;Knowledge Base&rdquo; rather than using it for daily logging. Daily logging shouldn&rsquo;t cause my knowledge base to expand infinitely; it makes management difficult.</li>
<li><strong>Notion:</strong> Powerful database features and a beautiful interface, but its speed and performance are issues. Limited by cloud services, every open requires loading, and it lacks offline functionality. This is fatal for a quick recording experience.</li>
<li><strong>OneNote:</strong> I barely used it. I dislike OneNote&rsquo;s design, and it feels too bloated. Also, despite running Windows 11, I try to avoid the Microsoft ecosystem as much as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Apple Notes:</strong> It’s truly a great app, but my Windows 11 PC can&rsquo;t use it.</li>
<li><strong>Bear:</strong> I used it a long time ago. It was the peak of aesthetics back then, but it doesn&rsquo;t stand out much now. Plus, it also doesn&rsquo;t work on Windows, and the free version is too restricted.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-final-choice-anytype">The Final Choice: Anytype</h2>

<p>Finally, we arrive at the software I am currently using—<strong>Anytype</strong>.</p>
<p>I tried Anytype before but was initially confused by its &ldquo;Object&rdquo; logic. Now that I&rsquo;ve revisited it, I find the logic quite easy to understand.</p>
<p>I found that Anytype truly satisfies all my requirements: <strong>Minimalist, Beautiful, Open Source, Private, Local-first, Image support, Publishing support, Markdown support, Data Export, and no major restrictions in the free version.</strong></p>
<p>My current workflow is very smooth: all notes can be assigned a status. Notes I want to archive are simply archived, and by setting up filters, I don&rsquo;t see them often, keeping the library clean. I can link notes freely and publish with one click. It has extensive features, and while it isn&rsquo;t perfect (the desktop client still has noticeable bugs and lacks the high degree of polish that Notion has), it gives me what I wanted most: <strong>Control and Freedom.</strong></p>
